<h1> Git and Github Tutorial - Part 0: What? </h1>

This preliminary part of the Git and Github tutorial will give a brief introdution to what exactly git is. The first thing to establish is the difference between Git, Github, and more broadly version control.

* <b> Version control systems </b> allow software developers to easily maintain and control different versions of their code. They allow their users to save snapshots of their code at different stages of development.
* [<b>Git</b>](https://git-scm.com) is a free open-source software control system. It is commonly found by default on many computer systems and terminals, and is used widely across both industry and academia. 
* [<b>Github</b>](https://github.com) is one of a few online services that provide hosting for github repositories (we'll go over what these are later). 

<h2> Version Control </h2>

Version control is an extremly usefull tool for those looking to develop software, as was stated, at their most basic they allow their users to save multiple versions of their code at the same time. However, it can be thought of even more simply than that - it dosn't neccisarily need to be code that you are saving. Most version control systems will allow you to keep versions of any type of file - anything in plain text of course, but binary files if the occasion arrives (although they will not neccisarily be to display the contents of those files in their interface).

These tutorials for example have been added to a git repository and uploaded to Github.

<h2> Git </h2>

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is one of many version control systems out there. It is one of the most popular, if not the most, however you may also encounter another version control system such as CVS, SVN, or another. If you know or find out your going to be using on of them don't be concerned, most verison control systems operate on similar priciples - and the intiuition on how to use them will also be transferable between systems. It is important to keep in mind that it is not the only version control system.

<h2> Github </h2>

A lot of people get confused and think that Github and Git are synonymous - but they are different things. Github is a for profit company whereas git is a free open source software tool. Github allows you to store github repositories online, backing up your repositories and allowing access to them from anywhere with a free internet connection.

Github is also not the only online repository. There are other services avalible such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) and [BitBucket](https://about.gitlab.com). Each have a slightly differnt setup and set of features, but again they operate in very similar ways, and in this case they all use Git, so any commands you learn will work across all of them. Which you use is a matter of personal preference, or more often than not, a matter of which tool the organisation you work for is already using.
