<h1> Git and Github Tutorial - Part 0: What? </h1>

This preliminary part of the Git and Github tutorial will give a brief introdution to what exactly git is. The first thing to establish is the difference between Git, Github, and more broadly version control.

* <b> Version control systems </b>, as there title suggests, allow software developers to easily maintain and control different versions of their code. 
* [<b>Git</b>](https://git-scm.com) is a free open-source software control system. It is commonly found by default on many computer systems and terminals, and is used widely across both industry and academia. 
* [<b>Github</b>](https://github.com) is one of a few online services that provide hosting for github repositories (we'll go over what these are later). 

<h2> Git </h2>

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is one of many version control systems out there. 

<h2> Github </h2>

A lot of people get confused and think that Github and Git are synonymous - but they are different things. Github is a for profit company whereas git is a free open source software tool.
