# PXT102/202 Git and Github Workshop
Demonstrators: Joe Askey and Michael Norman

This GitHub repository contains all the material for the "Git and Github Workshop".

Git is a popular tool used to manage coding projects by allowing users to track changes to their software over time. This allows users to revert to previous versions of the code (version-control), maintain code integrity to allow constant access to a working version, easily collaborate with teams on the same coding project, and provide a continuous backup of your project. It is an extremely useful aid in the code development process and when used properly it can save a lot of time and hassle. It is widely used across both academia and industry and the chances are that if you use coding in an any greater than trivial fashion you will end up encountering it at some point in your career.

This workshops runs through the very first steps in familiarising yourself with git. We will cover:
* Why? The benefits and real world application of version control.
* What? The data layout of a typical git setup as well as how that structure evolves through time and development.
* How? A typical workflow explaining how incorporate git into your coding practice in order to successfully streamline and maintain code development.

## To attend this workshop, you will need:
* To have made a GitHub account (https://github.com/join)
* Attended the BASH workshop, or be familiar with bash/working in the command line
* If using a Windows laptop, install: https://gitforwindows.org/
